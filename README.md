# Full-Stack Web Project

## Overview
This project is a web-based full-stack application focused primarily on the backend, designed with RESTful API principles and implemented using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The project utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to deliver a robust and scalable solution.

## Features
- **RESTful API Design**: A well-defined API structure allows for seamless communication between the client and server.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separation of concerns, making the application modular and maintainable.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilized for error handling, ensuring that errors are managed effectively and consistently.
- **Automated Mailing Process**: Integrated mailing functionality for notifications and other automated communications.
- **Filtered Queries**: Enhanced data retrieval with filtered queries for improved performance and user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js to build web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible data storage and retrieval.
